# More on datatypes 

Let's start with a few of the more common data types we'll use often:

1. INT - INT is a whole number with a max value of 2147483647 or negative -2147483647, some valid INT types are 12, 0, -9999, 1002345, -242345

2. VARCHAR (variable length string of characters), some example are 'coffee!', 'aasdsfsfr', you can also store numbers if you wrap them in quotes: -2345' And with VARCHAR, we can specify a max number of characters, like for a username, we can set the username to the VARCHAR type but max it out at 30 chars or however many chars we need
