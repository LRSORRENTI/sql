# Comparison and logical operators in SQL

Logical operators can help us refine our selections, things like 'select all books NOT published in 2017'

In many programming languages logical operators are used to check if the inverse of something, like != and can be chained with other things like || and &&, SQL has a similar feel to those, where we can use logic to refine our SQL

'Select all items in stock AND are below $19.99'
