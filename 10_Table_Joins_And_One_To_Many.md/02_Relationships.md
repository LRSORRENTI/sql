# Relationship Basics 

Relationships are common in data sets, users and orders, students and professors, inventory supplies and suppliers etc.. 

The first type of relationship we'll look at is called: 

1. ## ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP 

A one to one relaionship is less common, but an example would be a user details data, we have a user and a one to one relationship with that users details 

2. ## ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP 

This is a very common type of relationship for data, an example is the relationship with a product and reviews for that product, so one product, to many thousands of reviews. One to many. 


3. ## MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIP 

Many to many is relatively common, in the books example many authors can be connected to many books. Your Order table contains orders placed by multiple customers (who are listed in the Customers table), and a customer may place more than one order.
