# Table Joins and One To Many

This section deals with relationships between data. In real world scenarios, there are likes, comments, posts, photos, orders, transactions, and many more. 

We're really going to focus on how to work with interconnected data in this section. 

In our books database example, what if the books have different versions? Some books also have multiple credited authors, how do we ensure that all the authors for a book are connected? 

Often there a reviews for books, written by and connected to users, with titles, captions, and the review text itself. 

Data can be messy, and is often very interconnected. See the protein-db.png for a glance at a very interconnected structure.
